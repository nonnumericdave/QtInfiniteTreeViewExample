## QtInfiniteTreeViewExample
A sample application that details how to create an "infinite" tree view in Qt.

### Description
Typically, tree views have a finite number of elements.  However, it is possible to create a tree view architecture that will let your model provide an infinite number of elements.  Unfortunately, this means you have to get rid of the scrollbar for things to appear "right."  To serve as an example of this architecture, I've created a very basic calendar application which shows how this can be done.

### Requirements
This project was designed and built against Qt 5.6 on Mac OS X.

### Usage
Run "qmake" in the directory with Scheduler.pro, followed by "make".
